	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>This site makes it easy to visualize metes and bounds legal descriptions on a map. All you have to do is enter the legal description in the box below, and it will try to draw that legal description if possible.</p>
	<p>Note: This site has no guarantee of accuracy and should not be relied on for legal work. If you require help with property law, please hire a lawyer. If you are in Illinois, my law firm of <a href="https://www.allenandkorkowski.com/">Allen &amp; Korkowski &amp; Associates</a> would love to help you with any property law questions.</p>
	<div class="warning">This tool is very much a work in progress and still under construction. ðŸš§<br>Most functions are still unimplemented so most legal descriptions will not be drawn.</div>
